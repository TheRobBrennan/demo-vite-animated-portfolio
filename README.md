# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

## Getting started

### Initial setup

If you are spinning up the project for the first time, please run the `npm install` command to install our dependencies. Then, run `npm run dev` to view our application:

```sh
# Install our dependencies
% npm install

# Start our development server
% npm run dev
```

In the above example, we should be able to open our favorite web browser and navigate to []() ðŸŽ‰

Once we've verified our local development environment is up and running, it's time to do an initial deployment to Vercel:

```sh
% npx vercel@latest deploy --prod

```
